      <p>
        I'm a second-year student pursuing a BSc in Mathematics and Computer Science at JKUAT. I'm passionate about full-stack development and AI-powered solutions, especially in fraud detection for procurement systems. My goal is to combine technology and data science to solve real-world problems.
